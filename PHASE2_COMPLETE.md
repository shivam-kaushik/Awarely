# Phase 2 Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ All Requested Features Implemented

### âœ… Activity Recognition Integration
- **Status**: Complete
- **Files Created/Updated**:
  - `lib/core/services/activity_recognition_service.dart` - Service for detecting device activity
  - `lib/core/services/trigger_engine.dart` - Integrated activity monitoring
  - `lib/data/models/reminder.dart` - Added `activityType` and `useSmartTiming` fields
  - `lib/data/database/database_helper.dart` - Added database migrations (v5)

**Features**:
- Detects: walking, running, driving, stationary, cycling
- Real-time activity monitoring via Geolocator position stream
- Speed-based activity inference
- Activity-based reminder triggers
- Activity context stored in ContextEvent metadata

**How it works**:
1. ActivityRecognitionService monitors position changes
2. Infers activity from speed (still < 1 km/h, walking 1-5 km/h, etc.)
3. TriggerEngine checks reminders when activity changes
4. Matches current activity to reminder's `activityType`
5. Triggers notification when match is found

### âœ… Adaptive Timing (Learning Service)
- **Status**: Complete
- **Files Created/Updated**:
  - `lib/core/services/learning_service.dart` - Service for learning patterns
  - `lib/presentation/providers/reminder_provider.dart` - Integrated smart timing
  - `lib/data/database/database_helper.dart` - Added `learning_patterns` table

**Features**:
- Analyzes completion patterns by hour
- Learns optimal reminder timing
- Automatically adjusts future reminders
- Stores patterns in `learning_patterns` table
- Requires minimum 3 data points to learn

**How it works**:
1. LearningService analyzes context events for a reminder
2. Groups completed events by hour of day
3. Calculates completion rates per hour
4. Identifies hour with highest completion rate
5. When `useSmartTiming` is enabled, adjusts reminder time to optimal hour
6. Learns from new completions continuously

**Usage**:
- Set `useSmartTiming: true` on a reminder
- App learns from completion patterns
- Future reminders auto-adjust to optimal time

## Database Schema Updates

### Version 5 Migration

**New Reminder Fields**:
- `activityType TEXT` - Activity trigger type
- `useSmartTiming INTEGER DEFAULT 0` - Enable adaptive timing

**New ContextEvent Fields**:
- `activity_type TEXT` - Activity when event was triggered

**New Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE learning_patterns (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  reminder_text_pattern TEXT,
  optimal_time_hour INTEGER,
  optimal_time_minute INTEGER,
  completion_rate REAL,
  avg_response_time_seconds INTEGER,
  sample_count INTEGER,
  last_updated TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

## Integration Points

### TriggerEngine
- âœ… Monitors activity changes in real-time
- âœ… Triggers reminders when activity matches
- âœ… Stores activity context in events
- âœ… Checks activity in background periodic tasks

### ReminderProvider
- âœ… Applies smart timing adjustments before scheduling
- âœ… Learns from reminders after creation
- âœ… Updates reminders with adjusted times

### Activity Recognition Service
- âœ… Uses Geolocator position stream
- âœ… Infers activity from speed
- âœ… Provides callbacks on activity changes
- âœ… Battery-efficient (10m distance filter)

### Learning Service
- âœ… Analyzes completion patterns
- âœ… Stores optimal timing in database
- âœ… Provides time adjustment API
- âœ… Continuous learning from usage

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Activity Recognition**:
   - Walk around to trigger "walking" reminders
   - Drive (or simulate speed > 60 km/h) to trigger "driving" reminders
   - Stay still to trigger "stationary" reminders

2. **Smart Timing**:
   - Create a reminder with `useSmartTiming: true`
   - Complete it at different times
   - After 3+ completions, create another - should adjust to optimal time

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Activity changes should appear in logs
   - Smart timing adjustments should show in logs
   - Learning patterns should be logged after completions

---

## Summary

âœ… **Activity Recognition**: Fully integrated into TriggerEngine  
âœ… **Adaptive Timing**: LearningService created and integrated  
âœ… **Database**: All schema updates applied  
âœ… **No Linter Errors**: All code compiles successfully  

**Next Steps** (Optional):
- Add UI for selecting activity types in reminder creation
- Add toggle for smart timing in reminder dialog
- Visualize learning patterns in analytics
- Test on device to verify activity detection

All requested Phase 2 features (excluding device integrations) are now complete! ðŸš€
