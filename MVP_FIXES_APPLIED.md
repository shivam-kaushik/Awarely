# MVP Fixes Applied - Awarely

## 🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Notifications Not Showing
**Problem:** Scheduled notifications weren't firing when app was closed.

**Root Causes:**
- flutter_local_notifications schedules were correct, but no context events were created
- No tracking of notification delivery or user interaction
- Battery optimization may kill background processes

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Added automatic context event creation when notifications are scheduled (outcome: 'pending')
- ✅ Added tap handlers to record when user interacts with notifications (outcome: 'seen')
- ✅ Added battery optimization disable prompt in Settings
- ✅ Added exact alarm permission check at startup with debug logging
- ✅ Added test notification button in Settings to verify permissions work

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/services/notification_service.dart`
  - Added `_recordNotificationInteraction()` method
  - Added `_recordScheduledNotification()` method
  - Updated tap handlers to create context events in database
  - Imported DatabaseHelper and sqflite for direct DB access
  
- `lib/main.dart`
  - Added exact alarm permission check with debug logging
  
- `lib/presentation/screens/settings_screen.dart`
  - Added "Test Notifications" button
  - Added "Disable Battery Optimization" button

### 2. ✅ Recent Notifications Screen Empty
**Problem:** Screen showed "No recent notifications" even after creating reminders.

**Root Causes:**
- Context events were only created by TriggerEngine background checks
- Scheduled notifications didn't create context events
- No tracking of notification lifecycle

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Now creates context event when notification is scheduled (pending state)
- ✅ Creates context event when user taps notification (seen state)
- ✅ TriggerEngine still creates events for background triggers (missed state)
- ✅ Updated UI to show reminder text instead of ID
- ✅ Color-coded cards: Blue=pending, Green=seen, Orange=missed
- ✅ Better details dialog with full information

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/presentation/screens/recent_notifications_screen.dart`
  - Added reminder text lookup (caches reminders by ID)
  - Color-coded cards based on outcome
  - Improved details dialog
  - Better UI/UX with icons and formatting

### 3. ✅ All Permissions Documented & Requested

**Android Permissions in Manifest:**
- ✅ `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Show notifications (Android 13+)
- ✅ `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - Schedule precise notifications
- ✅ `USE_EXACT_ALARM` - Alternative exact alarm permission
- ✅ `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Restart notifications after device reboot
- ✅ `WAKE_LOCK` - Wake device for notifications
- ✅ `VIBRATE` - Vibrate on notification
- ✅ `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` - Show notifications when screen is off
- ✅ `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` - Display over other apps
- ✅ `RECORD_AUDIO` - Microphone for voice input
- ✅ `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - Approximate location
- ✅ `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - Precise location
- ✅ `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` - Location when app is closed
- ✅ `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Run background services

**Runtime Permission Requests:**
- ✅ Notification permission (requested at startup)
- ✅ Exact alarm permission (checked at startup, prompted in AddReminder)
- ✅ Microphone permission (prompted when mic button tapped)
- ✅ Location permission (prompted when needed for geofence)

**Files Modified:**
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (already had all permissions)
- `lib/main.dart` (added exact alarm check)
- `lib/core/services/permission_service.dart` (already had all helpers)

### 4. ✅ Mic Functionality Verified

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Speech-to-text integration in AddReminderScreen
- ✅ ensureMicrophonePermission() called before accessing mic
- ✅ Visual feedback (mic icon changes when listening)
- ✅ Automatic stop on completion
- ✅ Error handling for permission denial

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/presentation/screens/add_reminder_screen.dart` (already implemented correctly)

### 5. ✅ Pending Notifications Handling

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Added 'pending' outcome constant
- ✅ Scheduled notifications create context event with pending status
- ✅ Pending notifications show in Recent Notifications with blue badge
- ✅ Settings screen shows count of pending scheduled notifications
- ✅ Can verify pending via getPendingNotifications() in NotificationService

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` (added outcomePending)
- `lib/core/services/notification_service.dart` (creates pending events)
- `lib/presentation/screens/recent_notifications_screen.dart` (shows pending status)

1. Open Settings screen
2. Tap "Test Notifications" > "Send Test"
3. You should see immediate notification
4. After 30 seconds, scheduled notification should appear
5. Check Recent Notifications - should show 2 events (both pending initially)

### 2. Test Reminder Creation
1. Go to Home > Add Reminder
2. Type: "Take medicine at 8 PM" (pick a time 2-5 minutes from now)
3. Adjust time if needed
4. Create reminder
5. Check Recent Notifications - should show as "pending" with blue badge
6. Wait for scheduled time
7. Notification should fire
8. Tap notification
9. Check Recent Notifications - status should change to "seen" with green badge

### 3. Test Mic Functionality
1. Go to Add Reminder
2. Tap microphone icon
3. Grant permission if prompted
4. Speak: "Remind me to call mom at 7 PM"
5. Text should appear in input field
6. Create reminder and verify it works

### 4. Verify Permissions
1. Go to Settings
2. Check all permission statuses
3. Tap "Manage" for any disabled permission
4. Grant permissions via system settings
5. Return to app - status should refresh

### 5. Test Battery Optimization
1. Go to Settings
2. Tap "Disable Battery Optimization"

## 📊 Database Schema (Context Events)

```sql
CREATE TABLE context_events (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  reminderId TEXT NOT NULL,
  contextType TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'time', 'notification_tap', 'geofence', etc.
  triggerTime TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ISO8601 timestamp
  outcome TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'pending', 'seen', 'missed', 'completed', etc.
  metadata TEXT,              -- Optional JSON data
  FOREIGN KEY (reminderId) REFERENCES reminders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```

**Outcome States:**
- `pending` - Notification scheduled but not yet delivered
- `seen` - User tapped notification
- `missed` - Notification fired but not interacted with
- `completed` - User marked as done
- `snoozed` - User snoozed reminder
- `dismissed` - User dismissed notification

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Android Battery Optimization
**Issue:** Some manufacturers (Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung) aggressively kill background tasks.

**Workaround Applied:**
- ✅ USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT permission
- ✅ exactAllowWhileIdle scheduling mode
- ✅ High importance notification channel
- ✅ Battery optimization disable prompt

**Future Work:**
- Add manufacturer-specific detection and guidance
- Implement fallback notification strategies

### Workmanager Background Task
**Current:** Runs every 15 minutes to check time/wifi/geofence reminders.

**Issue:** May not run reliably on all devices due to battery optimization.

**Recommendation:** 
- Use scheduled notifications as primary delivery method
- Use Workmanager as backup for context-aware triggers (wifi, location)
- For time-based reminders, rely on flutter_local_notifications (already working correctly)

### iOS Support
**Status:** Partial support (notification permissions + scheduling should work).

**Missing:**
- iOS Info.plist permission strings not added yet
- Need to test on actual iOS device

**TODO:**
Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Microphone access is needed for voice input of reminders</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location is needed for place-based reminders</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Background location is needed for location-based reminders when app is closed</string>
```

### Recurrence (Repeat Reminders)
**Status:** Not implemented yet.

**Plan:**
- Add recurrence fields to Reminder model: `repeatInterval`, `repeatUnit`
- Batch-schedule next 24 hours of occurrences
- Top-up scheduling daily via Workmanager
- Cancel old occurrences when disabled/deleted

## 📱 App Startup Flow

```
main()
  ├── Initialize timezone data
  ├── Initialize Workmanager (background task every 15min)
  ├── Initialize NotificationService
  ├── Request notification permission
  ├── Check exact alarm permission (log warning if missing)
  └── Launch SplashScreen → Onboarding/Home
```

## 🔔 Notification Delivery Flow

### Time-Based Reminders
```
User creates reminder with time
  ├── ReminderProvider.createReminder()
  ├── NotificationService.scheduleNotification()
  │   ├── Creates zonedSchedule with exactAllowWhileIdle
  │   ├── Creates context_event (outcome: pending)
  │   └── Verifies scheduling via getPendingNotifications()
  └── Shows in Recent Notifications as "pending"

When scheduled time arrives:
  ├── flutter_local_notifications fires notification
  ├── User taps notification
  ├── _onNotificationTapped() creates context_event (outcome: seen)
  └── Recent Notifications shows "seen"
```

### Background Context Checks (Wifi/Geofence)
```
Workmanager periodic task (every 15min)
  ├── TriggerEngine.runBackgroundChecks()
  ├── checkWifiReminders() - checks wifi SSID
  ├── checkTimeReminders() - fallback time check
  ├── For each matched reminder:
  │   ├── TriggerEngine._triggerReminder()
  │   ├── Creates context_event (outcome: missed)
  │   └── Shows immediate notification
  └── Recent Notifications shows "missed"
```
