# 💼 Awarely - Investor Summary

## Executive Summary

**Awarely** is an AI-driven context-aware reminder assistant that solves the $2B problem of human forgetfulness by triggering reminders at the right **context**, not just the right time.

---

## The Problem

### Market Pain Point
- **Traditional reminder apps fail** because they trigger at fixed times, ignoring user context
- Example: "Leave for work" reminder fires while you're still at home
- **68% of reminder app users** report frequent "false alarm" notifications (internal survey)
- Human memory is **contextual**, not time-based

### Market Size
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: $4.2B productivity app market
- **Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**: $1.8B reminder/task management segment
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: $180M (10% of SAM, 3-year target)

---

## The Solution

### Core Innovation
**Context-Aware Triggering Engine** that fuses:
- Time of day
- GPS geolocation
- Wi-Fi SSID detection
- Motion/activity recognition
- Learned user patterns (ML)

### Example Use Cases
1. **"Take umbrella when leaving home in morning"** → Triggers only when GPS detects departure + time matches
2. **"Call Mom on Sunday evening"** → Reminds when user is stationary (not driving)
3. **"Turn off lights when leaving office"** → Triggers on geofence exit
