## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Memory issue on Gradle build** - Common on Windows, resolved by:
   - Closing other apps
   - Restarting IDE
   - Or running: `flutter clean && flutter run`

2. **TimeOfDay naming conflict** - Fixed with:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide TimeOfDay;
   ```

3. **AlarmManager integration** - Needs update to handle:
   - Time ranges (schedule multiple times per day)
   - Specific days (skip non-selected days)
